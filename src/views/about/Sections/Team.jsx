          <h5 class="description">
            Welcome to the Spree Programs. The Spree Gymnastics, Color Guard and
            Twirling Teams Programs are structured classes uniquely designed to
            enhance each child's self-esteem, physical ability and pride in a
            noncompetitive setting. The children progress at their own pace.
            With over 36 years experience working with children ages 2 through
            13, and 31 years teaching dance, gymnastics and baton twirling in
            private schools (1984-2000 in the NW Houston area, and 2001- present
            in Fort Wayne, Indiana), I look forward to working with your
            children in their safe, enthusiastic and supportive learning
            environment.
